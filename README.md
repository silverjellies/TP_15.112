# TP_15.112

The main code is in the mario_kart.py file. If you see the name before 5pm it's called the test.py file.
The original code allowed for mario to not travel or get stuck in the sky at all; however, this would be too laggy with the time complexity greater than n^2 dependent on a massive 2d list and the frame rate would be so desparingly slow. Thus, in order to address this issue, I no longer blocked mario from entering the sky when clicking the left, up, and right arrows so that I wouldn't have to recalculate the whole array/image every frame. Though now he had the ability to be perma stuck, so I unrestricted the down arrow and now when traveling backwards mario is able to fly in the sky. Please don't use the back arrow to cheat and only use it to unstuck yourself! The checkpoints are also there to ensure the whole path is completed each lap. You can uncomment the commetns that call 'updateCanvas' in the onKeyHold function if you want to reactivate the true barriers, though it'll be a little laggy
